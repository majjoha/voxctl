# ðŸŽ§ `voxctl`
`voxctl` is a command line tool for controlling the [VOX](https://vox.rocks)
music player from the terminal.

Under the hood, it works by proxying calls to [VOX](https://vox.rocks) using
[JavaScript for
Automation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/Articles/Introduction.html)
which was introduced in Mac OS X Yosemite. `voxctl` currently supports all
commands from the [VOX](https://vox.rocks) scripting suite.

## Requirements
* macOS 10.10 or newer.

## Installation
TBD.
